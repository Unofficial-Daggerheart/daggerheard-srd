    <p>Becoming a warrior requires years, often a lifetime, of training and
    dedication to the mastery of <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-weapon"
    data-bs-original-title>weapons</a> and violence. <span class="og-omit">While
    many who seek to fight hone only their strength, warriors understand the
    importance of an agile body and mind, making them some of the most
    sought-after fighters across the realms. Frequently, warriors find
    employment within an army, a band of mercenaries, or even a royal guard, but
    their potential is wasted in any position where they cannot continue to
    improve and expand their skills. Warriors are known to have a favored
    weapon; to come between them and their blade would be a grievous
    mistake.</span></p><p><span
